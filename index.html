            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>The history of New York begins around 10,000 B.C. when the first people arrived. By 1100 A.D. two main
                cultures had become dominant as the Iroquoian and Algonquian developed. European discovery of New York
                was led by the Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 followed by the first land claim in 1609 by the
                Dutch.</p>
